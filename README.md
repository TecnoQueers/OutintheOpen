 ### Out in the Open!

## The Context - Why we created Out in the Open! ?

 LGBTQI+ populations are battling a growing conservative wave that is threatening to roll back the rights and freedom of their communities; at the same time, technology and innovation are advancing at a speed that makes it hard for human rights organizations to keep up with. These challenges combined make it more important than ever to forge collaborative networks that share knowledge, advance common understanding, and foster the collective leadership of civil society organizations to respond to emerging threats. 
 
The attention economy and the surveillance capitalism, propel the capacity of authoritarian governments and conservative groups to use technology to target LGBTQI+ communities fueling human rights abuses and eroding the capacity of digital rights and LGBTQI+ organizations to advance the rights of vulnerable populations.

The need to tackle the human rights of LGBTQI+ communities in the digital environment from an innovative and bold perspective is becoming urgent by the minute. Stronger collaborations and effective participatory mechanisms are needed to strengthen collective leadership to set LGBTQI+ populations  at the center of the human rights response in the digital sphere.

The lack of resources to develop data and systematization mechanisms, as well as the lack of funding to use technology and strengthen tech-literacy of civil society are some of the challenges that are eroding the capacity of LGBTQI+ organizations to mitigate the impact of human rights abuses in the digital environment.

Collective intelligence can strengthen the capacity to generate evidence-informed strategies based on machine learning supported human rights documentation and analysis of evidence to influence policies and practices that advance LGBTQI+ rights in the digital environment.

## What are we doing?

 Out in the Open! will tap into the potential of collective intelligence to solve the most pressing issues faced by  LGBTQI+ populations in the digital environment.

Open leadership, collective problem solving, and greater participation of communities affected can lead to better solutions [1][link_collectivesolving] . Using hybrid models of machine learning and collaborative knowledge networks can lead to new opportunities to galvanize collective intelligence in the LGBTQI+ and digital rights arena.

 Your contribution is crucial to Out in the Open! success. Your vision is needed to connect the dots between a broad range of innovation tools and elements that unleash the potential of the collective intelligence elements we aim to experiment with.

## Who are we?

The co-founders of  Out in the Open! are LGBTQI+ and digital rights activists working in the frontlines to defend human rights in the digital environment.
